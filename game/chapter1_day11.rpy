    m "The morning of Sarah's trip to New York felt different. The air was charged with a quiet anticipation, a mix of her excitement and my own subtle apprehension. She was up even earlier than usual, moving with a focused energy as she double-checked her packing list."

    s "Did I remember my charger?" She muttered to herself, rummaging through her carry-on. "And my presentation notes? Oh, and that new power bank Mr. Henderson recommended."

    m "I've got the chargers, babe." I said, holding up a handful of cords. "And your notes are right here." I handed them to her, trying to catch her eye, but her gaze was already flitting to her watch."

    s "Thanks, [mc_name]. You're a lifesaver." She gave me a quick, distracted kiss on the cheek. "I really need to get going. Traffic to the airport is going to be a nightmare."

    m "I know." I followed her to the front door, feeling a familiar pang of loneliness already setting in. "Call me when you land, okay?"

    s "Of course!" She smiled, a genuine, bright smile, but her eyes were already looking past me, towards the waiting car. "Love you!"

    m "Love you too, Sarah!" I called after her, watching her get into the taxi. The car pulled away, and the street, usually bustling with morning activity, felt suddenly empty. The house felt even emptier."

    m "I spent the rest of the morning in a strange limbo. The silence was deafening. I tried to distract myself with chores, but my mind kept drifting to Sarah, already miles away, embarking on her new adventure. I was proud of her, truly. But a part of me, a selfish, needy part, just wanted her here."

    m "The day dragged on. I went to work, but my heart wasn't in it. David's usual banter seemed louder, more intrusive. The customers' questions felt more demanding. I just wanted the day to be over, so I could hear Sarah's voice, even if it was just for a few minutes."

    m "My phone finally buzzed around 6 PM. A text from Sarah: 'Landed safely! Crazy day already. Talk soon! Love you!'"

    m "A wave of relief washed over me, followed by a familiar ache. She was safe. She was busy. And I was here, alone. It was just for a few days, I reminded myself. Just a few days. We would make it work. We always did."
