    m "The second day of Sarah's trip felt even longer than the first. The initial novelty of having the house to myself had worn off, replaced by a dull ache of absence. Work was a distraction, but even there, her absence was felt."

    d "Still no word from the big city?" David asked, as I was helping a customer load a bag of topsoil into his truck. He always seemed to know when I was thinking about Sarah.

    m "She texted last night. Busy with client dinners." I said, trying to sound casual, but the words felt hollow.

    d "Client dinners, huh?" David raised an eyebrow, a familiar glint in his eye. "Sounds glamorous. Hope she's not working too hard."

    m "She loves her job, David." I said, a little more sharply than I intended. "It's important to her."

    d "Hey, easy there, tiger." David held up his hands in mock surrender. "Just making conversation. You're a little on edge, [mc_name]. Missing her already?"

    m "Of course I am." I sighed, leaning against the counter. "It's just... weird. Not having her around."

    d "Yeah, I get it. My wife went to visit her sister for a week once. House felt like a tomb. You just gotta find ways to keep busy." David offered, surprisingly empathetic.

    m "I nodded, appreciating his attempt at comfort. He was right. I needed to keep busy. But what? The evenings stretched out before me, long and empty."

    m "I got home, and the silence hit me harder than usual. I tried to cook, but my heart wasn't in it. The food tasted like ash. I tried to watch TV, but every show seemed to remind me of something Sarah and I would watch together."

    m "Around 9 PM, my phone buzzed. A video call from Sarah! My spirits lifted immediately. I answered, eager to see her face."

    s "(on video call) Hey, honey! Sorry I couldn't call earlier. It's been a crazy day!"

    m "No worries, babe. Just good to see your face." Her face filled the screen, looking a little tired, but still beautiful. She was in a hotel room, the background a blur of generic art."

    s "(on video call) Just got back from a dinner with Mr. Henderson and some potential investors. It went really well! We're making great progress."

    m "That's great, Sarah! I knew you'd crush it." I smiled, genuinely happy for her success, even as a tiny part of me wished she was here.

    s "(on video call) I miss you, [mc_name]. It's weird being here without you. The bed feels huge." She pouted playfully.

    m "I miss you too, babe. More than you know. The house is too quiet without you." I tried to keep my voice light, but a hint of longing crept in.

    s "(on video call) I know. Just a few more days. I'll be home before you know it. I promise to make it up to you. Big time." She winked, and I felt a blush creep up my neck.

    m "I'll hold you to that." I chuckled. "Get some rest, okay? You sound exhausted."

    s "(on video call) I will. You too. Love you!"

    m "Love you more!" I said, as she blew a kiss and the call ended. The screen went dark, and the silence returned, heavier this time. She missed me. That was good. But she was still so far away."

    m "I spent the next hour just staring at the ceiling, replaying our conversation. She missed me. She really did. But the client dinners, the investors, Mr. Henderson... it all felt so far removed from our life here. I pushed the thoughts away. She was coming home soon. That's all that mattered."
