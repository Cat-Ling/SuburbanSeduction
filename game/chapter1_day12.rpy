    m "The first day of Sarah's New York trip felt incredibly long. The house, usually filled with her vibrant energy, was eerily quiet. Every shadow seemed to stretch, every creak of the floorboards amplified in her absence."

    m "I went to work, but my mind was constantly drifting. I found myself checking my phone every few minutes, hoping for a call, a text, anything more substantial than the brief 'Landed safely!' she'd sent last night."

    d "Missing the missus already, huh?" David asked, leaning against the counter, a knowing smirk on his face. "It's only been a day, [mc_name]."

    m "Just checking in." I shrugged, trying to appear nonchalant. "She's got a big meeting today."

    d "Big city, big meetings." David chuckled. "Don't worry, she'll be back before you know it. Probably with a fancy New York accent and a new appreciation for our little town."

    m "I forced a laugh, but David's words, meant to be reassuring, only amplified my unease. New York. It was a world away from our quiet suburban life. Would she still appreciate our little town after experiencing the hustle and bustle of the big city?"

    scene bg_home_evening with dissolve # Assuming a home evening background
    m "The evening was the hardest. I made myself dinner, but it tasted bland. I tried to watch TV, but my attention kept wandering. I just wanted to hear her voice."

    m "Around 8 PM, my phone rang. It was Sarah! My heart leaped. "Hey, babe! How was your first day?"

    s "(on phone) Hey, honey! It was insane! So much to do, so many people to meet. I'm completely exhausted." Her voice was a little muffled, and I could hear background noise, like she was in a busy place."

    m "Sounds intense. Are you okay?"

    s "(on phone) Yeah, just tired. Listen, I'm actually on my way to a client dinner right now. Mr. Henderson insisted. I just wanted to call quickly before I lost signal."

    m "Oh. A client dinner. Right." My voice felt flat, even to my own ears. "Well, have fun. Don't work too hard."

    s "(on phone) I won't. I miss you already. Talk soon, okay? I'll try to call you tomorrow, but it might be late. Love you!"

    m "Love you too, Sarah." The line went dead. I stared at my phone, the silence in the room pressing in on me. A client dinner. With Mr. Henderson. Of course. It was part of her job. But still...

    m "I tried to push away the tiny, unwelcome tendrils of doubt. She was busy. She was working. This was what she wanted. And I supported her. I had to. But the evening felt long, and the bed felt incredibly empty."
